## Why these .gitignore patterns?
We ignore build artifacts (e.g., /target, *.class) and editor/system files (.idea, .vscode, .DS_Store) so the repo only tracks source, keeping diffs clean and clones small.
## Branch strategy
- **author/idea-sprint**: fast drafting of new zine content.
- **editor/review**: edits, tone, and consistency checks before merging to `main`.
